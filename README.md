 ## How To Play
 
 First you need to create the players with **/api/v1/players/create/{playerName}** endpoint
 Afterwards start the game with **/api/v1/game/start/{player1},{player2}** endpoint
 It will return the starter player's name
 Player needs to draw a card with **/api/v1/game/draw/{playerName}** endpoint first in order to play his turn
 Each player gains a mana crystal when it is their turn
 If the player doesnt have enough mana to play a card their turn will end
 If the player does have mana to play cards, their turn will end when they dont have anymore mana or dont have anymore cards
 Each turn players mana's are restored according to their mana crystals
 Each player has 30 hp, each card deals damage equal to their manacosts
 Each player has 20 cards in their deck and draw random 3 cards at beginning and 1 random card each turn
 if player doesnt have any cards in his deck and tries to draw a card that player receives 1 damage
 If a player has 0 or lower hp they lose the game
 
- enjoy ;)
